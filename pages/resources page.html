        <p class="Resources-by-action-para">Disarmament</p>
        <p>Disarmament means reducing or eliminating weapons. It aims to create a safer world by lowering the risk of conflicts and wars. Countries agree to destroy or limit certain types of weapons, like nuclear arms or chemical weapons. This helps promote peace and stability, allowing nations to focus on cooperation and development instead of spending resources on military buildup.</p>

        <p class="Resources-by-action-para">Sustainability and Climate Change</p>
        <p>Sustainability and climate change are closely linked. Climate change is the long-term shift in Earth's weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels. Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising future generations' ability to meet their own needs. To combat climate change, we need to adopt sustainable practices like reducing our carbon footprint, conserving energy and water, and protecting our natural resources. This ensures a healthier planet for everyone.</p>
